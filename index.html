      <h1>Amy Rogers</h1>
      <p>For the past seven years, I’ve worked as a product designer and user researcher. Right now I’m reworking my portfolio to better reflect the kinds of projects I’d like to work on, so bear with the emptiness here!</p>
      <p>I’m also building up my digital operations studio, <a href="https://gubbins.studio">Gubbins</a>. Here I’m building workspaces and processes that help people stay happy and productive.</p>
      <p>If you'd like to work together you can find me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/amymaude">LinkedIn</a>. I’m also writing articles on design and productivity, which you can read on <a href="https://amymrogers.medium.com">Medium</a>.</p>  
      <p>You can book some time for a chat if you like, or send me general work enquiries using this form. Thanks!</p>
